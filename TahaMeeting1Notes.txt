talking points for project

what do we want to do for wiki? text document?

we should begin with design always draw.io or whatever to structure

always committing even if small week by week

constant communication with client and TA

questions about math one

how will we be dividing the content with the other group??

how will we separate content? 
by grade? 
how do you want to post your math content? 
we can generate interactive gasified learning but which subjects would be most important? 
shall we separate by class? do we want analytics behind the students grades implemented?
should there be a messaging system for the students to communicate with teacher? 
database for students and their grades, along with their activity, and maybe times of activity? 
should some of the content added by teachers be interactive and allow the teachers to ‘build’ the website ex. using little default objects like ‘show answer’ after a question?

what level are we dealing with? school board level or individual school level? by class? what colour scheme should we use for the website portion? are there any themes? fonts? (comic sans)

should we host quizzes on the website and retain the results? what methods of testing would you like functionality for? (MCQ, submit pdf, etc)

what games would you like to see implemented? 
only quests or perhaps did you have some other varieties of games in mind?
what subjects should we focus on?

quests are composed of a variety of mini games to decipher clues of an end goal, what do you think about having a ‘mini game library’ of sorts to composed the quest from? This way you can ensure quests are fresh and new while still retaining some familiarity if you will, or if a certain mini game focuses on a concept the class is struggling with, you can put it in the next quest as well.

perhaps we can invent a website where there is teacher login and student login. teacher login allows for creation of a quest and input of specifications while student login allows completion of the quest. the question is, where should the quest go after the teacher inputs the specifications? the quest will appear on the students login. there will be no other information other than a ‘start’ button. (prototype) the students press it and complete their attempt. the grade they receive (could be numerical, alphabetical, or pass/fail) will be stored in the database along with other previous records of theirs. we should also create a visualization component on the teacher page to provide access to these records.

who should create the student accounts? the students themselves or the teacher?

Client Vision:

- French important 
- Project all together
- Students love quests (games)
- 25 did a full quest (out of 99)
- XP
- Games - Interactive - Do the work - Solutions (not just answer) - Fun - Give points/XP - Export student profile? -
- Random events (dont use opposable thumbs, cant say yes or no) *** - wheel spinning?
- Netmath = no solutinos
- xtramath - progression in levels (start with addition - move on to multiplication)
- World to be created (Magical Pirate ship) Theme
- GAMES ONLY
- Each student has their own avatar
- Vioned 
- Teacher able to become the "game master" 
- Make student avatar viewing teacher's video
- Game instrucions in video format
- One grade or multiple grades? Grade 7 first then Grade 8 (Starting with French ontarion curiculum) mainly math
- France - Spanish?
- Equations in games 
- Teaching coding
   - mblock
   - Coding incorperated in some games somehow?
- Number of games
   - 5-6 Challenges
   - Some challenges can have more challenges inside
- Instead of games being fully completed (skeletons of games - for teachers to customise?)
- Tool for game creation?
- Games without timers (not all)
- Quick games with timers (5+5)
- Last challenge -> always problem resolution
- Final boss game - problem resolution - always at the end of the challenge
- Items/familiars and things as part of the games
   - Students get XP - every 2000 they get a level - can choose a item for avatar - Lose XP for losing game
   - Crystals (give powers) - Forget about this part for now
   - Hearts (lose all hearts and die) - Leave out for now
   - Gold coins 
- familiars
   - give hints
   - remove wrong answers
   - kids choose 1/2 cards at every level that can be applied once during the school year
   - First 5 at certain level can have teacher "kidnaped" for a lesson 
   - If you have power - click here
   - Higher the level the better the powers (battle pass?)

- Tracking completion

- THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
    - This is our course
    - Don't start something too big and not be able to finish it
    - Be happy with the ecperience at the end

- Each game has 3 lives (have to beat game within those lives)
   - Game restarts with different values
   - Hints might pop up if lots of restart (Demarche)
   - XP only if game is completed

DREAM:
- Elf 

GOALS for the end of the semester
- big bank of games 
- implement level progression and powers to a certain extent
- 

Updates for the project:
- Emails (something more urgent?)
- Meeting in a week (ideas + design)
- From then meeting once every 2 weeks
- Time: usually this time is good (6pm - 6:30pm*)

Next Meeting:
- Design Sketches
    - Games
- Plan
- Requirements
- Working on appearance of games

Johanne side:
- Oficial decision on pirate theme
- some sketches 
- Exercises
