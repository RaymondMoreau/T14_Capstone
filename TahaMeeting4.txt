Client Meeting:
Need to know exactly what needs to be done by the end of this semester

Website:

Feedback on Taha game:
- get the ball rolling on quickfire games
- Add one thing: Time based

Feedback on Haris game:
- Time based - if he gets stuck has to answer question quickly to get out
- Hits razer blade - goes down a level (make game last longer)
- Change colour/theme of games 

Keep in mind:
- Game itself is the skeleton (able to modify it easily)

Feedback on Ashton game:
- Add one thing: Time based
- 

Client Favour/Requests:
- Thing students love most from classcraft -> Random events
- Random goofy events that the kids have to do during the class time 
- EX:
 	- Speak like old times for the day
	- If teacher says specific students name -> Get 100 points for class or something

- Wheel spinner that chooses a random event (event dissapears once its selected)

Client website feedback:
- Look Gamie and pirate themed
- Buttons can be nice frames 
- Nice backgrounds
- Focus more on design in the summer
- Johanne will try to make a design of how she wants the website to look
- Focus more on functionality

- Remember the escape rooms (would be cool)
- Done in a way to make the student feel like he is in the room (if possible)
- Focus on games for now

Goals for the Semester:
- Make website look good
- Discuss database stuff on our own time
