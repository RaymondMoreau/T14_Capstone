    <li>Which subjects are most important for interactive gamified learning?</li>
    <li>Should analytics behind student grades be implemented?</li>
    <li>Consider adding a messaging system for student-teacher communication.</li>
    <li>Database for students' grades, activity, and times of activity?</li>
    <li>Should some content added by teachers be interactive and allow the teachers to ‘build’ the website (e.g., using default objects like ‘show answer’ after a question)?</li>
    <li>What level are we targeting? School board level or individual school level?</li>
    <li>Consider color schemes, themes, and fonts for the website.</li>

    <li>What methods of testing functionality should be included? (MCQ, submit PDF, etc.)</li>
    <li>Which games should be implemented?</li>
    <li>Focus areas for subjects?</li>
    <li>Consider a 'mini game library' for quests.</li>
