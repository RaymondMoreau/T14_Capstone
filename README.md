Team 14's Capstone Project. All software developed for the project will be pushed to this repository. 

Project Outline: Our group will be working on a portion of the 'Math Learning Platform' project specified on the Capstone website. We will be focusing on developing the games which will be used in the client's 'Quests'. Teachers will be able to choose which games to add into their quests and the students will be able to complete them, earning XP for themselves.

Team members and roles: 
Raymond Moreau, 300199575, Organization & Communication
Ashton Hagar, 300197676, Logistics and Framework
Haris Vohra, 300174288, Lead Architect
Taha Houssari, 300175366, Testing & Software QA

Objectives: We want to develop a library of functional games that the client can use in her Quests that she publishes to her students. We want to host a database to track the students progress along the games and Quests. We will develop a minimal (can be expanded if extra time) front-end for hosting these games where they will be accessible from.

The benefit of the completion of this project to the client, Mme. Séguin, would be a potential business opportunity to capitalize on an undersaturated online math-game learning experience that teachers and students will love.

Success in this project will look like a collection of math/educational related games that records individual students progress (XPs). There will be a teacher/admin part of the front-end allowing for teacher analytics to assess how the students are learning and which areas they require help. Teachers would be able to choose certain games to take part of a quest and generate interesting stories for the quest.

Expected Architecture: Game development software (looking at Unity right now), and then have a website to host the Unity games.

Anticipated Risks: Technical issues, content quality, cultural sensitivity, and one typically discovers more as a project goes on!

Legal and Social Issues: Copyright/plagiarism with game assets, accessibility, data privacy + security, gambling (?), and ensuring we follow proper educational standards.

Initial plans for first release: Prototype website with all games working, questions will be randomly generated, the database will track a users progress.

List of documents:

Have you achieved what you planned for the first semester?
Our goal initially for this semester was to get the functionality of our games done, as well as a website to host the games. Overall, we feel that this semester has been a success in terms of what we wanted to complete. We managed to make a couple games each at least with most if not all the functionality implemented. Furthermore we managed to get a website done to host our games. Finally, we also got a database up and running, which we initially didn't plan for, but it was a big and important step for our project.

What is your plan for the second semester?
We plan on working throughout the summer semester, during the summer term we would like to continue polishing up our games, mainly on the aesthetic side. As well as polishing up the website and the database. As for the fall semester, which would be the last term for this project. We would like to implement automated integrated testing for all of the components of our system. Which includes the database, the website and potentially our games as well. We would also like to add any extra functionalities that we may not have had the time for in previous semester. Finally, we would like to tie up any loose ends for the completion of our project.
