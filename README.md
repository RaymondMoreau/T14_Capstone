Team 14's Capstone Project. All software developed for the project will be pushed to this repository. 

Outline: Our group will be working on a portion of the 'Math Learning Platform' project specified on the Capstone website. We will be focusing on developing the games which will be used in the client's 'Quests'. Teachers will be able to choose which games to add into their quests and the students will be able to complete them, earning XP for themselves.

Team members and roles: 
Raymond Moreau, 300199575, Organization & Communication

Ashton Hagar, 300197676, Logistics and Framework

Haris Vohra, 300174288, Lead Architect

Taha Houssari, 300175366, Testing & Software QA

Objectives: We want to develop a library of functional games that the client can use in her Quests that she publishes to her students. We want to host a database to track the students progress along the games and Quests. We will develop a minimal (can be expanded if extra time) front-end for hosting these games where they will be accessible from.

Initial plans for first release: Prototype website with all games working, questions will be randomly generated, the database will track a users progress.
