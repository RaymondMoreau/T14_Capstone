Team 14's Capstone Project. All software developed for the project will be pushed to this repository. 

Project Outline: Our group will be working on a portion of the 'Math Learning Platform' project specified on the Capstone website. We will be focusing on developing the games which will be used in the client's 'Quests'. Teachers will be able to choose which games to add into their quests and the students will be able to complete them, earning XP for themselves.

** NOTE ** For Medieval Math and Familiar Fight, these games use our database that is not always 100% active. If there games fail to work, please contact us so we can run the database for you. (emails below)

Objectives: We want to develop a library of functional games that the client can use in her Quests that she publishes to her students. We want to host a database to track the students progress along the games and Quests. We will develop a minimal (can be expanded if extra time) front-end for hosting these games where they will be accessible from.

The benefit of the completion of this project to the client, Mme. Séguin, would be a potential business opportunity to capitalize on an undersaturated online math-game learning experience that teachers and students will love.

Success in this project will look like a collection of math/educational related games that records individual students progress (XPs). There will be a teacher/admin part of the front-end allowing for teacher analytics to assess how the students are learning and which areas they require help. Teachers would be able to choose certain games to take part of a quest and generate interesting stories for the quest.

Expected Architecture: Game development software (looking at Unity right now), and then have a website to host the Unity games.

Anticipated Risks: Technical issues, content quality, cultural sensitivity, and one typically discovers more as a project goes on!

Legal and Social Issues: Copyright/plagiarism with game assets, accessibility, data privacy + security, gambling (?), and ensuring we follow proper educational standards.

Initial plans for first release: Prototype website with all games working, questions will be randomly generated, the database will track a users progress.
