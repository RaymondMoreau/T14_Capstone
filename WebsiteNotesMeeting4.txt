Website notes from Johanne for future editions

------------------------------------------

Look gamey and colourful, pirate themed

Use some graphics from games

Change the buttons to be nicely framed pngs

Make it look like pirates and jungle

Add backgrounds for each of the games and the site (check classcraft)

Imagination and cohesion with the main website
