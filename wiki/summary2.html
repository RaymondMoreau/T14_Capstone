  <h2>Challenges Encountered during semester</h2>
  <h3>Assets and Sprite Creation</h3>

  <p>Issue with AI generated assets not being continuous and lacking consistency between generations (eg. Knight will have a sword and
    shield in 1 part of the animation, and just a sword in the next). To resolve this, we started sourcing our assets from free online
    asset websites for games requiring animated sequences.</p>

  <h3>Compatibility Issues</h3>

  <p>Something we should have given more thought too was considering any possible compatibility issues we might have had, and made a 
    mitigation plan in case they came up. For example, when we first started hosting our games on the web we faced some issues with the 
    resolution of the games, some of our assets would be cut off from view. Another compatibility issue we had is that Github could not 
    support the size of each Unity game, so we had to resort to creating individual repositories for our games. Overall, our compatibility 
    issues were mitigated but it would have been a lot more helpful to have considered these issues before they came up.</p>

  <h3>Communication and Collaboration</h3>

  <p>We had weekly meetings with our client discussing the progress of the work and any updates we had. We ended not having that many meetings
    as a team, we feel that we should have had more scheduled meetings and discuss internally the progress of our project. We would've liked to
    communicate more effectively, frequently keeping the team updated on each other's progress through our Discord chat. Given the nature of our
    project, it can be easy to isolate yourself while working on your own games. In the future, we would like to improve on this and make more
    time for ourselves as a team to communicate more effectively.</p>

    <h2>Updates to original proposal</h2>

    <p>Wasn't too many extra things tacked on, just different game ideas and features. The client was also more specific with the types of games she wanted.
        For example, she specified she liked having random events in her classes, and wanted us to create a randomized spinner wheel that would pick between
        her random events for the class. Requested that we model off of some of her google sheets games that she made to fill the void with classcraft going down
        (We made Quadradle as a response for this). She wanted her excel sheets of questions to be uploaded to the database which was feasible and some are currently
        in the database now. 

        <b>She also requested that we go in-person to playtest the games with her students! As an excellent form of QC/QA, we organized to go December 11th.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Relevant Design, Implementation, Requirements</h2>

    <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lpm1Lo1VidqaY0O538MC2VnFUmhQkdjbiDX7Er4HB24/edit?tab=t.0">Requirements Elicitation Document</a><br>
    
    Design Drafts and Ideas can be found in the GameConcepts folder of the T14_Capstone folder.<br>

    Implementation was done via GitHub Pages, and you have the links above on this page.</p>

    <h2>Final Achievements</h2>

    <p>For a group with no prior experience with Unity or game development as a whole, we picked up game development rather fast. While also managing
        meeting with our client, team, and capstone class, our team managed to develop a vast array of games, and showed flexibility when responding to
        client wishes. As a group we kept organized and met internal deliverables with ourselves. We developed imaginative game concepts and executed 
        to the highest degree we could. Our group considers this semester a success and thanks the professor+TAs for providing us this learning experience
        and for connecting us with our fantastic client Mme. Seguin! :)
    </p>

    <h2>Deployment</h2>

    <p>Being able to host the games on GitHub pages was great for us, as most free hosting services and spotty or non-functional. At times, with Unity export
        to web there was issues with the resolutions when hosting on a website. Whether one had their browser zoomed or would fullscreen the game it could cause
        issues but for now most if not all of these are patched and our games are successfully deployed to github. <br> The database is hosted on a free hosting
        platform, meaning we can only host it for about 30 seconds before it goes down. This is unfortunate as the games won't work unless the database is up, 
        requiring the host to sit at their computer monitoring and restart the database constantly. To combat this, we only developed two games to rely on the database
        while the rest used static values. This ensures that whoever accesses the site will be able to play at least some games with the database down. This is also
        better from a development standpoint as we wouldn't require the host to be online to test if our games work, and could continue developing independently.
    </p>

    <h2>Handover Plans</h2>

    <p>We plan to .zip all of our games, which can then be opened from Unity Hub with the "Add from disk" option (when downloaded). We will put these on a google
        drive to let the next group view what we did, how we did it, and continue with the project.
    </p>

    <h2>Leftover Notes</h2>
    <p>It is difficult to track our development as our "code" is done in the unity editor, but the portions of our games that required C# code we exported
        to a folder in T14_Capstone called C#, so you can view it and the comments inside.
