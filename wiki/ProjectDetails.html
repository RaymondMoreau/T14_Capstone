  <h1>Team 14's Capstone Project</h1>
  <p>All software developed for the project will be pushed to this repository.</p>

  <h2>Project Outline:</h2>
  <p>Our group will be working on a portion of the 'Math Learning Platform' project specified on the Capstone website.</p>
  <p>We will be focusing on developing the games which will be used in the client's 'Quests'.</p>
  <p>Teachers will be able to choose which games to add into their quests and the students will be able to complete them, earning XP for themselves.</p>

  <h2>Team members and roles:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Raymond Moreau, 300199575 - Organization & Communication</li>
    <li>Ashton Hagar, 300197676 - Logistics and Framework</li>
    <li>Haris Vohra, 300174288 - Lead Architect</li>
    <li>Taha Houssari, 300175366 - Testing & Software QA</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Objectives:</h2>
  <p>We want to develop a library of functional games that the client can use in her Quests that she publishes to her students.</p>
  <p>We want to host a database to track the students' progress along the games and Quests.</p>
  <p>We will develop a minimal (can be expanded if extra time) front-end for hosting these games where they will be accessible from.</p>

  <h2>Benefits:</h2>
  <p>The completion of this project to the client, Mme. Séguin, would be a potential business opportunity to capitalize on an undersaturated online math-game learning experience that teachers and students will love.</p>

  <h2>Success Criteria:</h2>
  <p>A collection of math/educational related games that records individual students' progress (XPs).</p>
  <p>Teacher/admin part of the front-end allowing for teacher analytics to assess how the students are learning and which areas they require help.</p>
  <p>Teachers can choose certain games for a quest and generate interesting stories.</p>

  <h2>Expected Architecture:</h2>
  <p>Game development software (looking at Unity right now), and then have a website to host the Unity games.</p>

  <h2>Anticipated Risks:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical issues</li>
    <li>Content quality</li>
    <li>Cultural sensitivity</li>
    <li>Discovering more risks as the project progresses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal and Social Issues:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Copyright/plagiarism with game assets</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Data privacy + security</li>
    <li>Gambling (?), ensuring compliance with educational standards</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Initial Plans for First Release:</h2>
  <p>Prototype website with all games working, questions will be randomly generated, the database will track a user's progress.</p>
