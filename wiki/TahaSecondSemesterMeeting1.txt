Goals and deadlines (October):
- Try as much as possible to find games that are interesting 
- Games as templates, that can be then taken and used for new material and concepts
- All we need to focus on is the games
- Anything that can look like a quest is a big bonus (interaction, dialogue, etc.)
- 

- start with mockups and drawings 
- present them 
- 

This is the foundation for the future, product might not look exactly as we are developping it
