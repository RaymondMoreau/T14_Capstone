        <p>Meeting 3 Notes:

            Using unity for game development
            
            - Prototypes created for initial games
            - Expectations have been managed by client
            - Still learning unity - but progressing nicely
            
            - No update/email from github for Johanne
            - 
            
            Ben Franklin Game:
            - Way for question in games to be modified easily 
            - Library of questions that can be chosen for different games
            - CSV file with bank of questions (made by Johanne)
            - Everything being done in excel sheets - uploaded into games once its ready
            - All games based on same sort of questions/question bank
            
            Temple run game:
            - Environment + player set up
            - Unity assets
            - Background gonna change
            - Terrain will stay
            - Character will be a pirate
            - Villain will chase him
            - 2D movement
            - Flappy bird like game
            - As obstacle come - player will have to solve math questions
            - Bonus questions - Gain lives after completing them
            -
            
            Ashton Game:
            - Question  functionality to be added
            - Different difficulty of questions (harder ones will do more damage)
            - Assets can be changed to fit our themes (enemy)
            - 
            
            Client happy with games right now
            
            Client notes:
            - Marian Small - Math teacher 
            - Built a site - payed for by ontario government
            - No quests - but has some games
            - Elon Musk website -> Math tutor built in the website (something to think about for the future)
            
            Things to add to think about for games:
            - Games will be connected directly to other site
            - Quick math games will not be connected (kids can freely practice as much as they want) - like extramath
            - 5-6 or more of quick fire practice questions (math) (like walk the plank)
            - Test for first time they enter site (without practice) - if they pass without issues - move on to next level
            - Quick fire practice questions
            
            - Escape room games (if possible)
            - Go your own way - be creative
            - Walk around the room and click on different objects - answer question related to object - once all questions answered they can move on to next room
            - look good to the kids
            
            Priority:
            1. Regular Games
            2. Extra math type games
            3. Escape rooms
            
            For next meeting:
            - Continue working on these games
            - Come up with more quick fire games
            - Maybe prototype some escape rooms
            - Demarche is important (show how to solve the problems)
