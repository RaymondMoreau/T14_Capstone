Meeting 2 Notes:

- Client (Johanne) added to the github repository

What kind of games Client wants:
- Games that they can do fast
- Games that they have to think
- Some games with animation through different stages (games where they have to think - problem solving)
- Game where they build something as they get the correct answers (progression based) (kids like doing this even with lots of work)
- Boss game - where they damage the boss over time (can choose more difficult questions to do more damage)

GENERAL NOTES:
- Game template: Where we can switch out images/questions - easily adaptable
- Randomized answers that aren't too far off correct answer
- *possibility of having false answers based off common mistakes (more difficulty to implement)
- Johanne: "if you wanna cheat, cheat, you're stupid"

- Escape room ideas as games (template - story line changes and values/questions changes)

- Practice small additions/substractions/multiplications/division - VERY IMPORTANT TO CLIENT (levels - increasing in difficulty - starting at very basic stuff) (10 mins a day) (seperate game that they have to do every day) - maybe with highscore

- If possible* - Teacher checks all games a student played in a week etc. 
- If possible* - Some games with video interaction 

OUR GAMES:
AH Games:
- Boss Battle: Can be replaced with anything (doesn't have to be a dragon)
	- Replayability: Percentages associated with boss (maybe to drop loot, incentivise students to study games again)
	- Certain things from doing games, other things from quests
- ShapesInStars: Finding angles (triangle stuff, you have A and B, find C) parallel lines etc.

HV Games:
- Temple run concept: Obstacles in the way, have to jump - to jump you would have to answer a question correctly (time limit)
	- Time gets shorter and questions harder as time progresses (xp also increases)
	- Potential leaderboard with students highscores* (maybe better for at home)
- Treasure Chest Calculations: More for fractional questions and graph questions. Financial literacy (value of gold increases as game goes on - knowing when to sell gold at right time

RM Games:
- Benjamin Franklin Game: Prevent Benjamin from getting electrocuted, correct answer will be the safe cloud (other clouds will electrocute him) (good story in the game)
- Egypt Game: top piece of pyramid missing, student has to figure out which piece fits, based off question requirement
	- Johanne: Game idea of maze under pyramid - fits in with this game potentially (as a quest)
- Evil Letter Book Game: evil letters attacking pirates, good letters, correct answer fights evil letter and wins, wrong answer would lose
- Mushroom Game: Student jumps on correct mushroom, based on # of spots on each mushroom 

TH Games:


Future:
- Adapting games to different topics - not just math
